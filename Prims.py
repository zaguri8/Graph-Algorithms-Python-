# Associate with each vertex v of the graph a number C[v] 
# (the cheapest cost of a connection to v) and an edge E[v] (the edge providing that cheapest connection). To initialize these values, set all values of C[v] to +âˆž (or to any number larger than the maximum edge weight) and set each E[v] to a special flag value indicating that there is no edge connecting v to earlier vertices.
# Initialize an empty forest F and a set Q of vertices that have not yet been included in F (initially, all vertices).
# Repeat the following steps until Q is empty:
# Find and remove a vertex v from Q having the minimum possible value of C[v]
# Add v to F
# Loop over the edges vw connecting v to other vertices w. For each such edge, 
# if w still belongs to Q and vw has smaller weight than C[w], perform the following steps:
# Set C[w] to the cost of edge vw
# Set E[w] to point to edge vw.
# Return F, which specifically includes the corresponding edges in E
